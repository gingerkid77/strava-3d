3D visualisation of Strava GPX data using React &amp; Three.js

## Overview
I wanted to learn a little React and play around with GPX data from my many cycling activities on Strava. 

## What it does
Creates a three.js scene. Allows you to load a GPX file locally which gets parsed. The data is then processed into points for a line and visualised using the Three.js renderer.
